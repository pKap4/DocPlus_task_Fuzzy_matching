# DocPlus_task_Fuzzy_matching
A possible solution to the task that was provided as an assessment for an intern position, using a fuzzy string matching library(fuzzball.js)
It is a basic web page that includes a text box to type our words into, from which we can predict the symptom that the user is going to type into the textbox, before it has been completely typed.
The solution uses a javascript library called fuzzball.js, which is a helpful nlp library that implements fuzzy string matching, based on the Levenshtein distance.
